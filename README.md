# rack_health_check gem ![build status](https://travis-ci.org/marciotoshio/rack_health_check.svg?branch=master "build status")

Simple health check of rack apps.

The basic goal is to quickly check that rack app is up and running and that it has access to correctly configured resources (database, redis, memcached, elasticsearch or whatever you want)

## Checks

- http

## Installation

Add the following line to Gemfile

`gem 'rack_health_check'`

And then execute

`bundle`

Or install it yourself as:

`gem install rack_health_check`

## Configuration

To change the configuration of health_check, create a file `config/initializers/rack_health_check.rb` and add a configuration block like:

    RackHealthCheck.config do |config|

      # Path for do the check
      config.path = '/health_check'

      # Text output upon success
      config.success = 'success'

      # Http status code when any exception occurs
      config.http_status_for_error = 500

      # Strategies that you want to check
      config.strategies = [
        RackHealthCheck::Strategy::Http
      ]
    end

## Uptime Monitoring

Use a website monitoring service to check the url regularly for the word "success" (without the quotes) rather than just a 200 http status so
that any substitution of a different server or generic information page should also be reported as an error.

If an error is encounted, the text "some error message/s" will be returned and the http status will be 500.
